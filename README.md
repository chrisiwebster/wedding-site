## Accessibility

I will test using:

- Google Chrome WCAG colour extensions.
- A screen reader.
- Lighthouse Google Chrome extension.

## Design process

For my UX module, I wrote an essay about the double diamond design method, so I have used this approach in my design.

1. Research other wedding websites. What did they include? (Discover)
2. From research determine what to include in my site. (Define)
3. Create the first draft of the website. Here I also asked people to test and provide feedback. (Develop)
4. Once feedback has been actioned, deliver the final version. (Deliver)
